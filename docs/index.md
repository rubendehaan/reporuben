## Hi!

Hi. My name is Ruben and I participate in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. With this website I keep track of my findings, progression, reflections and encounters that I experience along this course. Thanks for joining me!
